# Enforce that the default gnome keyring is in plaintext format.
# The rationale for this is that people generally do not know what keyring
# is and how it works, and if user password is changed (from Puavo), the
# keys in keyring will be locked and the user is repeatedly prompted to
# open keyring, not knowing what that means (the old password should be
# used for opening the keyring).  Only the default keyring will be forced
# to plaintext, other keyrings can be used normally.
