# This script is called from udev rules when udev detects a change in 
# monitor configuration. All xrandr commands are called to restore 
# the configuration. This is needed e.g. with document cameras that 
# cause displays to come and go on regular basis.
#
# udev rule example:
#
# ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="drm", RUN+="/usr/bin/udev-hotplug-monitor"
